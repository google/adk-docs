**An open-source, code-first Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and
deploying sophisticated AI agents with flexibility and control.**

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for developers seeking fine-grained
control and flexibility when building advanced AI agents that are tightly
integrated with services in Google Cloud. It allows you to define agent
behavior, orchestration, and tool use directly in code, enabling robust
debugging, versioning, and deployment anywhere ‚Äì from your laptop to the cloud.

See the code at [ADK-python](https://github.com/google/adk-python).

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions,
  OpenAPI specs, or integrate existing tools to give agents diverse
  capabilities, all for tight integration with the Google ecosystem.

- **Code-First Development**: Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration
  directly in Python for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.

- **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Design scalable applications by composing
  multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.

- **Deploy Anywhere**: Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or
  scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.

## üöÄ Installation

You can install ADK using `pip`:

```bash
pip install google-adk
