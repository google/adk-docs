# Inside agent logic (conceptual)

# 1. Modify state
ctx.session.state['status'] = 'processing'
event1 = Event(..., actions=EventActions(state_delta={'status': 'processing'}))

# 2. Yield event with the delta
yield event1
# --- PAUSE --- Runner processes event1, SessionService commits 'status' = 'processing' ---

# 3. Resume execution
# Now it's safe to rely on the committed state
current_status = ctx.session.state['status'] # Guaranteed to be 'processing'
print(f"Status after resuming: {current_status}")
