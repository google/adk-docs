# Simplified view of logic inside Agent.run_async, callbacks, or tools

# ... previous code runs based on current state ...

# 1. Determine a change or output is needed, construct the event
# Example: Updating state
update_data = {'field_1': 'value_2'}
event_with_state_change = Event(
    author=self.name,
    actions=EventActions(state_delta=update_data),
    content=types.Content(parts=[types.Part(text="State updated.")])
    # ... other event fields ...
)

# 2. Yield the event to the Runner for processing & commit
yield event_with_state_change
# <<<<<<<<<<<< EXECUTION PAUSES HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>

# <<<<<<<<<<<< RUNNER PROCESSES & COMMITS THE EVENT >>>>>>>>>>>>

# 3. Resume execution ONLY after Runner is done processing the above event.
# Now, the state committed by the Runner is reliably reflected.
# Subsequent code can safely assume the change from the yielded event happened.
val = ctx.session.state['field_1']
# here `val` is guaranteed to be "value_2" (assuming Runner committed successfully)
print(f"Resumed execution. Value of field_1 is now: {val}")

# ... subsequent code continues ...
# Maybe yield another event later...
