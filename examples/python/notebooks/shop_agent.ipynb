        "# Build an e-commerce recommendation AI agents with ADK + Vector Search\n",
        "\n",
        "Original Author(s): [Kaz Sato](https://github.com/kazunori279)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a simple multi-agent system for an e-commerce site, designed to offer the \"Generative Recommendations\" you find in the [Shopper's Concierge demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwHPYyw7u6U). A step-by-step guide video is also available [here](https://youtu.be/07GX28rk7Yc).\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Generative Recommendation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generative Recommendation refers to the AI's ability to not only retrieve items directly matching a user's explicit search query but also to **intelligently infer, expand upon, or create new search queries and item suggestions based on a deeper understanding of the user's intent, external research, or contextual information.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of its capabilities as demonstrated:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Understanding and Expanding User Intent:** Instead of simply taking a direct query, the system can interpret the underlying need. For instance, when a user asks for a \"birthday present for 10 years old boy,\" the AI doesn't just search for those exact keywords.\n",
        "2.  **Leveraging External Research (Google Search):** The \"Generative Recommendation\" process involves using tools like Google Search to perform market research. This allows the AI to understand what kind of items are generally purchased for a given intent (e.g., popular gifts for 10-year-old boys).\n",
        "3.  **Generating New Queries:** Based on this research, the AI actively *generates* a list of more specific and diverse search queries. These generated queries go beyond the initial user input, aiming to broaden the search and find more relevant results (e.g., \"educational toys for 10-year-olds,\" \"adventure books for boys,\" \"coding kits for kids\").\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, \"Generative Recommendation\" moves beyond simple keyword matching to a more dynamic and intelligent approach where the AI proactively assists the user by generating new ideas and relevant search paths to help them discover desired products.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the end, we will build an agent system that works in the following flow:\n",
