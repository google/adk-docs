# --- Authentication Configuration ---
# This section configures how the agent will handle authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC),
# often layered on top of OAuth 2.0.

# Define the Authentication Scheme using OpenID Connect.
# This object tells the ADK *how* to perform the OIDC/OAuth2 flow.
# It requires details specific to your Identity Provider (IDP), like Google OAuth, Okta, Auth0, etc.
# Note: Replace the example Okta URLs and credentials with your actual IDP details.
# All following fields are required, and available from your IDP.

    # The URL of the IDP's token endpoint where the authorization code is exchanged for tokens.
    token_endpoint="https://your-token-endpoint.okta.com/oauth2/v1/token",
    # The scopes (permissions) your application requests from the IDP.
    # 'openid' is standard for OIDC. 'profile' and 'email' request user profile info.
    scopes=['openid', 'profile', "email"]
)

# Define the Authentication Credentials for your specific application.
# This object holds the client identifier and secret that your application uses
# to identify itself to the IDP during the OAuth2 flow.
# !! SECURITY WARNING: Avoid hardcoding secrets in production code. !!
# !! Use environment variables or a secret management system instead. !!

# --- Toolset Configuration from OpenAPI Specification ---
# This section defines a sample set of tools the agent can use, configured with Authentication
# from steps above.
# This sample set of tools use endpoints protected by Okta and requires an OpenID Connect flow

)

# --- Ready for Use ---
# The `root_agent` is now configured with tools protected by OIDC/OAuth2 authentication.
# When the agent attempts to use one of these tools, the ADK framework will automatically
# trigger the authentication flow defined by `auth_scheme` and `auth_credential`
# if valid credentials are not already available in the session.
# The subsequent interaction flow would guide the user through the login process and handle
# token exchanging, and automatically attach the exchanged token to the endpoint defined in
# the tool.
