# Agent Observability with MLflow

[MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/) provides
first‑class support for ingesting OpenTelemetry (OTEL) traces. Google ADK emits
OTEL spans for agent runs, tool calls, and model requests, which you can send
directly to an MLflow Tracking Server for analysis and debugging.

## Prerequisites

- MLflow version 3.6.0 or newer. OpenTelemetry ingestion is only supported from
  MLflow 3.6+.
- A SQL‑based backend store (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL). File‑based stores
  do not support OTLP ingestion.
- Google ADK installed in your environment.

## Install dependencies

```bash
pip install "mlflow>=3.6.0" google-adk opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
```

## Start the MLflow Tracking Server

Start MLflow with a SQL backend and a port (5000 in this example):

```bash
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --port 5000
```

You can point `--backend-store-uri` to other SQL backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL). OTLP ingestion is not supported with file‑based backends.

## Configure OpenTelemetry (required)

You must configure an OTLP exporter and set a global tracer provider before using any ADK components so that spans are emitted to MLflow.
Initialize the OTLP exporter and global tracer provider in code before importing or constructing ADK agents/tools:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor

exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint=f"http://localhost:5000/v1/traces",
    headers={"x-mlflow-experiment-id": "123"}  # replace with your experiment id
)

provider = TracerProvider()
provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter))
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)  # set BEFORE importing/using ADK
```

This configures the OpenTelemetry pipeline and sends ADK spans to the MLflow server on each run.

## Example: trace a simple ADK agent

```python
# my_agent/agent.py
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool


def calculator(a: float, b: float) -> str:
    """Add two numbers and return the result."""
    return str(a + b)


calculator_tool = FunctionTool(func=calculator)

root_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="MathAgent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction=(
        "You are a helpful assistant that can do math. "
        "When asked a math problem, use the calculator tool to solve it."
    ),
    tools=[calculator_tool],
)
```

Run the agent with:

```bash
adk run my_agent
```

## View traces in MLflow

Open the MLflow UI at `http://localhost:5000`, select your experiment, and inspect the trace tree and spans generated by your ADK agent.

## Tips

- Set the tracer provider before importing or initializing ADK objects so all spans are captured.
- Behind a proxy or on a remote host, replace `localhost:5000` with your server address.
