# Using Different Models with ADK

!!! Note
    Java ADK currently supports Gemini and Anthropic models. More model support coming soon.

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for flexibility, allowing you to
integrate various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your agents. While the setup
for Google Gemini models is covered in the
[Setup Foundation Models](../get-started/installation.md) guide, this page
details how to leverage Gemini effectively and integrate other popular models,
including those hosted externally or running locally.

ADK primarily uses two mechanisms for model integration:

1. **Direct String / Registry:** For models tightly integrated with Google Cloud
   (like Gemini models accessed via Google AI Studio or Vertex AI) or models
   hosted on Vertex AI endpoints. You typically provide the model name or
   endpoint resource string directly to the `LlmAgent`. ADK's internal registry
   resolves this string to the appropriate backend client, often utilizing the
   `google-genai` library.
2. **Wrapper Classes:** For broader compatibility, especially with models
   outside the Google ecosystem or those requiring specific client
   configurations (like models accessed via LiteLLM). You instantiate a specific
   wrapper class (e.g., `LiteLlm`) and pass this object as the `model` parameter
   to your `LlmAgent`.

The following sections guide you through using these methods based on your needs.

## Using Google Gemini Models

This section covers authenticating with Google's Gemini models, either through Google AI Studio for rapid development or Google Cloud Vertex AI for enterprise applications. This is the most direct way to use Google's flagship models within ADK.

**Integration Method:** Once you are authenticated using one of the below methods, you can pass the model's identifier string directly to the
`model` parameter of `LlmAgent`.


!!!tip 

    The `google-genai` library, used internally by ADK for Gemini models, can connect
    through either Google AI Studio or Vertex AI.

    **Model support for voice/video streaming**

    In order to use voice/video streaming in ADK, you will need to use Gemini
    models that support the Live API. You can find the **model ID(s)** that
    support the Gemini Live API in the documentation:

    - [Google AI Studio: Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#live-api)
    - [Vertex AI: Gemini Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api)

### Google AI Studio

This is the simplest method and is recommended for getting started quickly.

*   **Authentication Method:** API Key
*   **Setup:**
    1.  **Get an API key:** Obtain your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    2.  **Set environment variables:** Create a `.env` file (Python) or `.properties` (Java) in your project's root directory and add the following lines. ADK will automatically load this file.

        ```shell
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
        export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        ```

        (or)
        
        Pass these variables during the model initialization via the `Client` (see example below).

* **Models:** Find all available models on the
  [Google AI for Developers site](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models).

### Google Cloud Vertex AI

For scalable and production-oriented use cases, Vertex AI is the recommended platform. Gemini on Vertex AI supports enterprise-grade features, security, and compliance controls. Based on your development environment and usecase, *choose one of the below methods to authenticate*.

**Pre-requisites:** A Google Cloud Project with [Vertex AI enabled](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow;apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

### **Method A: User Credentials (for Local Development)**

1.  **Install the gcloud CLI:** Follow the official [installation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2.  **Log in using ADC:** This command opens a browser to authenticate your user account for local development.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
3.  **Set environment variables:**
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="YOUR_VERTEX_AI_LOCATION" # e.g., us-central1
    ```     
    
    Explicitly tell the library to use Vertex AI:

    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
    ```

4. **Models:** Find available model IDs in the
  [Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models).

### **Method B: Vertex AI Express Mode**
[Vertex AI Express Mode](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview) offers a simplified, API-key-based setup for rapid prototyping.

1.  **Sign up for Express Mode** to get your API key.
2.  **Set environment variables:**
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_EXPRESS_MODE_API_KEY_HERE"
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
    ```

### **Method C: Service Account (for Production & Automation)**

For deployed applications, a service account is the standard method.

1.  [**Create a Service Account**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create#console) and grant it the `Vertex AI User` role.
2.  **Provide credentials to your application:**
    *   **On Google Cloud:** If you are running the agent in Cloud Run, GKE, VM or other Google Cloud services, the environment can automatically provide the service account credentials. You don't have to create a key file.
    *   **Elsewhere:** Create a [service account key file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#console) and point to it with an environment variable:
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/keyfile.json"
        ```
    Instead of the key file, you can also authenticate the service account using Workload Identity. But this is outside the scope of this guide.

**Example:**



!!!warning "Secure Your Credentials"
    Service account credentials or API keys are powerful credentials. Never expose them publicly. Use a secret manager like [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to store and access them securely in production.

## Using Gemma Models

[Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google. The ADK provides a dedicated wrapper to integrate Gemma models into your agents.

**Integration Method:** Instantiate the `Gemma` wrapper class and pass it to the `model` parameter of your `LlmAgent`.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Authentication:** Follow the same authentication setup as for [Google AI Studio](#google-ai-studio) using an API key.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **No System Instructions:** Gemma models do not support system instructions. Any system-level prompts will be converted to user-level prompts by the ADK.
*   **Limited Function Calling:** Gemma's native function calling support is not as extensive as Gemini's. The ADK attempts to parse function calls from the model's text output, but this may be less reliable.
*   **No Vertex AI Support:** The current integration is for the Gemini API only and does not support Gemma models hosted on Vertex AI.

**Example:**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.models import Gemma

# --- Example Agent using the Gemma 3 27B IT model ---
agent_gemma = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemma(model="gemma-3-27b-it"),
    name="gemma_agent",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant powered by Gemma.",
    # ... other agent parameters
)
```

## Using Anthropic models

![java_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_in-Java-orange){ title="This feature is currently available for Java. Python support for direct Anthropic API (non-Vertex) is via LiteLLM."}

You can integrate Anthropic's Claude models directly using their API key or from a Vertex AI backend into your Java ADK applications by using the ADK's `Claude` wrapper class.

For Vertex AI backend, see the [Third-Party Models on Vertex AI](#third-party-models-on-vertex-ai-eg-anthropic-claude) section.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Dependencies:**
    *   **Anthropic SDK Classes (Transitive):** The Java ADK's `com.google.adk.models.Claude` wrapper relies on classes from Anthropic's official Java SDK. These are typically included as **transitive dependencies**.

2.  **Anthropic API Key:**
    *   Obtain an API key from Anthropic. Securely manage this key using a secret manager.

**Integration:**

Instantiate `com.google.adk.models.Claude`, providing the desired Claude model name and an `AnthropicOkHttpClient` configured with your API key. Then, pass this `Claude` instance to your `LlmAgent`.

**Example:**




## Using Cloud & Proprietary Models via LiteLLM

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_in-Python-blue)

To access a vast range of LLMs from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic (non-Vertex
AI), Cohere, and many others, ADK offers integration through the LiteLLM
library.

**Integration Method:** Instantiate the `LiteLlm` wrapper class and pass it to
the `model` parameter of `LlmAgent`.

**LiteLLM Overview:** [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/) acts as a translation
layer, providing a standardized, OpenAI-compatible interface to over 100+ LLMs.

**Setup:**

1. **Install LiteLLM:**
        ```shell
        pip install litellm
        ```
2. **Set Provider API Keys:** Configure API keys as environment variables for
   the specific providers you intend to use.

    * *Example for OpenAI:*

        ```shell
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
        ```

    * *Example for Anthropic (non-Vertex AI):*

        ```shell
        export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
        ```

    * *Consult the
      [LiteLLM Providers Documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)
      for the correct environment variable names for other providers.*

        **Example:**

        ```python
        from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
        from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm

        # --- Example Agent using OpenAI's GPT-4o ---
        # (Requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
        agent_openai = LlmAgent(
            model=LiteLlm(model="openai/gpt-4o"), # LiteLLM model string format
            name="openai_agent",
            instruction="You are a helpful assistant powered by GPT-4o.",
            # ... other agent parameters
        )

        # --- Example Agent using Anthropic's Claude Haiku (non-Vertex) ---
        # (Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
        agent_claude_direct = LlmAgent(
            model=LiteLlm(model="anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307"),
            name="claude_direct_agent",
            instruction="You are an assistant powered by Claude Haiku.",
            # ... other agent parameters
        )
        ```

!!!warning "Windows Encoding Note for LiteLLM"

    When using ADK agents with LiteLLM on Windows, you might encounter a `UnicodeDecodeError`. This error occurs because LiteLLM may attempt to read cached files using the default Windows encoding (`cp1252`) instead of UTF-8.

    To prevent this, we recommend setting the `PYTHONUTF8` environment variable to `1`. This forces Python to use UTF-8 for all file I/O.

    **Example (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    # Set for the current session
    $env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"

    # Set persistently for the user
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYTHONUTF8', '1', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
    ```


## Using Open & Local Models via LiteLLM

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_in-Python-blue)

For maximum control, cost savings, privacy, or offline use cases, you can run
open-source models locally or self-host them and integrate them using LiteLLM.

**Integration Method:** Instantiate the `LiteLlm` wrapper class, configured to
point to your local model server.

### Ollama Integration

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) allows you to easily run open-source models
locally.

#### Model choice

If your agent is relying on tools, please make sure that you select a model with
tool support from [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools).

For reliable results, we recommend using a decent-sized model with tool support.

The tool support for the model can be checked with the following command:

```bash
ollama show mistral-small3.1
  Model
    architecture        mistral3
    parameters          24.0B
    context length      131072
    embedding length    5120
    quantization        Q4_K_M

  Capabilities
    completion
    vision
    tools
```

You are supposed to see `tools` listed under capabilities.

You can also look at the template the model is using and tweak it based on your
needs.

```bash
ollama show --modelfile llama3.2 > model_file_to_modify
```

For instance, the default template for the above model inherently suggests that
the model shall call a function all the time. This may result in an infinite
loop of function calls.

```
Given the following functions, please respond with a JSON for a function call
with its proper arguments that best answers the given prompt.

Respond in the format {"name": function name, "parameters": dictionary of
argument name and its value}. Do not use variables.
```

You can swap such prompts with a more descriptive one to prevent infinite tool
call loops.

For instance:

```
Review the user's prompt and the available functions listed below.
First, determine if calling one of these functions is the most appropriate way to respond. A function call is likely needed if the prompt asks for a specific action, requires external data lookup, or involves calculations handled by the functions. If the prompt is a general question or can be answered directly, a function call is likely NOT needed.

If you determine a function call IS required: Respond ONLY with a JSON object in the format {"name": "function_name", "parameters": {"argument_name": "value"}}. Ensure parameter values are concrete, not variables.

If you determine a function call IS NOT required: Respond directly to the user's prompt in plain text, providing the answer or information requested. Do not output any JSON.
```

Then you can create a new model with the following command:

```bash
ollama create llama3.2-modified -f model_file_to_modify
```

#### Using ollama_chat provider

Our LiteLLM wrapper can be used to create agents with Ollama models.

```py
root_agent = Agent(
    model=LiteLlm(model="ollama_chat/mistral-small3.1"),
    name="dice_agent",
    description=(
        "hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime"
        " numbers."
    ),
    instruction="""
      You roll dice and answer questions about the outcome of the dice rolls.
    """,
    tools=[
        roll_die,
        check_prime,
    ],
)
```

**It is important to set the provider `ollama_chat` instead of `ollama`. Using
`ollama` will result in unexpected behaviors such as infinite tool call loops
and ignoring previous context.**

While `api_base` can be provided inside LiteLLM for generation, LiteLLM library
is calling other APIs relying on the env variable instead as of v1.65.5 after
completion. So at this time, we recommend setting the env variable
`OLLAMA_API_BASE` to point to the ollama server.

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_BASE="http://localhost:11434"
adk web
```

#### Using openai provider

Alternatively, `openai` can be used as the provider name. But this will also
require setting the `OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1` and
`OPENAI_API_KEY=anything` env variables instead of `OLLAMA_API_BASE`. **Please
note that api base now has `/v1` at the end.**

```py
root_agent = Agent(
    model=LiteLlm(model="openai/mistral-small3.1"),
    name="dice_agent",
    description=(
        "hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime"
        " numbers."
    ),
    instruction="""
      You roll dice and answer questions about the outcome of the dice rolls.
    """,
    tools=[
        roll_die,
        check_prime,
    ],
)
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=anything
adk web
```

#### Debugging

You can see the request sent to the Ollama server by adding the following in
your agent code just after imports.

```py
import litellm
litellm._turn_on_debug()
```

Look for a line like the following:

```bash
Request Sent from LiteLLM:
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:11434/api/chat \
-d '{'model': 'mistral-small3.1', 'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': ...
```

### Self-Hosted Endpoint (e.g., vLLM)

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_in-Python-blue)

Tools such as [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) allow you to host
models efficiently and often expose an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

**Setup:**

1. **Deploy Model:** Deploy your chosen model using vLLM (or a similar tool).
   Note the API base URL (e.g., `https://your-vllm-endpoint.run.app/v1`).
    * *Important for ADK Tools:* When deploying, ensure the serving tool
      supports and enables OpenAI-compatible tool/function calling. For vLLM,
      this might involve flags like `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and potentially
      a specific `--tool-call-parser`, depending on the model. Refer to the vLLM
      documentation on Tool Use.
2. **Authentication:** Determine how your endpoint handles authentication (e.g.,
   API key, bearer token).

    **Integration Example:**

    ```python
    import subprocess
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm

    # --- Example Agent using a model hosted on a vLLM endpoint ---

    # Endpoint URL provided by your vLLM deployment
    api_base_url = "https://your-vllm-endpoint.run.app/v1"

    # Model name as recognized by *your* vLLM endpoint configuration
    model_name_at_endpoint = "hosted_vllm/google/gemma-3-4b-it" # Example from vllm_test.py

    # Authentication (Example: using gcloud identity token for a Cloud Run deployment)
    # Adapt this based on your endpoint's security
    try:
        gcloud_token = subprocess.check_output(
            ["gcloud", "auth", "print-identity-token", "-q"]
        ).decode().strip()
        auth_headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {gcloud_token}"}
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not get gcloud token - {e}. Endpoint might be unsecured or require different auth.")
        auth_headers = None # Or handle error appropriately

    agent_vllm = LlmAgent(
        model=LiteLlm(
            model=model_name_at_endpoint,
            api_base=api_base_url,
            # Pass authentication headers if needed
            extra_headers=auth_headers
            # Alternatively, if endpoint uses an API key:
            # api_key="YOUR_ENDPOINT_API_KEY"
        ),
        name="vllm_agent",
        instruction="You are a helpful assistant running on a self-hosted vLLM endpoint.",
        # ... other agent parameters
    )
    ```

## Using Hosted & Tuned Models on Vertex AI

For enterprise-grade scalability, reliability, and integration with Google
Cloud's MLOps ecosystem, you can use models deployed to Vertex AI Endpoints.
This includes models from Model Garden or your own fine-tuned models.

**Integration Method:** Pass the full Vertex AI Endpoint resource string
(`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/endpoints/ENDPOINT_ID`) directly to the
`model` parameter of `LlmAgent`.

**Vertex AI Setup (Consolidated):**

Ensure your environment is configured for Vertex AI:

1. **Authentication:** Use Application Default Credentials (ADC):

    ```shell
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

2. **Environment Variables:** Set your project and location:

    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="YOUR_VERTEX_AI_LOCATION" # e.g., us-central1
    ```

3. **Enable Vertex Backend:** Crucially, ensure the `google-genai` library
   targets Vertex AI:

    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
    ```

### Model Garden Deployments

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

You can deploy various open and proprietary models from the
[Vertex AI Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)
to an endpoint.

**Example:**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.genai import types # For config objects

# --- Example Agent using a Llama 3 model deployed from Model Garden ---

# Replace with your actual Vertex AI Endpoint resource name
llama3_endpoint = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/endpoints/YOUR_LLAMA3_ENDPOINT_ID"

agent_llama3_vertex = LlmAgent(
    model=llama3_endpoint,
    name="llama3_vertex_agent",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant based on Llama 3, hosted on Vertex AI.",
    generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(max_output_tokens=2048),
    # ... other agent parameters
)
```

### Fine-tuned Model Endpoints

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

Deploying your fine-tuned models (whether based on Gemini or other architectures
supported by Vertex AI) results in an endpoint that can be used directly.

**Example:**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

# --- Example Agent using a fine-tuned Gemini model endpoint ---

# Replace with your fine-tuned model's endpoint resource name
finetuned_gemini_endpoint = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/endpoints/YOUR_FINETUNED_ENDPOINT_ID"

agent_finetuned_gemini = LlmAgent(
    model=finetuned_gemini_endpoint,
    name="finetuned_gemini_agent",
    instruction="You are a specialized assistant trained on specific data.",
    # ... other agent parameters
)
```

### Third-Party Models on Vertex AI (e.g., Anthropic Claude)

Some providers, like Anthropic, make their models available directly through
Vertex AI.
