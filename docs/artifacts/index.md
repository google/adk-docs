In ADK, **Artifacts** represent a crucial mechanism for managing named, versioned binary data associated either with a specific user interaction session or persistently with a user across multiple sessions. They allow your agents and tools to handle data beyond simple text strings, enabling richer interactions involving files, images, audio, and other binary formats.

!!! Note
    The specific parameters or method names for the primitives may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `save_artifact` in Python, `saveArtifact` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

## What are Artifacts?

*   **Definition:** An Artifact is essentially a piece of binary data (like the content of a file) identified by a unique `filename` string within a specific scope (session or user). Each time you save an artifact with the same filename, a new version is created.

*   **Representation:** Artifacts are consistently represented using the standard `google.genai.types.Part` object. The core data is typically stored within an inline data structure of the `Part` (accessed via `inline_data`), which itself contains:
    *   `data`: The raw binary content as bytes.
    *   `mime_type`: A string indicating the type of the data (e.g., `"image/png"`, `"application/pdf"`). This is essential for correctly interpreting the data later.


=== "Python"

    ```py
    # Example of how an artifact might be represented as a types.Part
    import google.genai.types as types

    # Assume 'image_bytes' contains the binary data of a PNG image
    image_bytes = b'\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n...' # Placeholder for actual image bytes

    image_artifact = types.Part(
        inline_data=types.Blob(
            mime_type="image/png",
            data=image_bytes
        )
    )

    # You can also use the convenience constructor:
    # image_artifact_alt = types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_bytes, mime_type="image/png")

    print(f"Artifact MIME Type: {image_artifact.inline_data.mime_type}")
    print(f"Artifact Data (first 10 bytes): {image_artifact.inline_data.data[:10]}...")
    ```

=== "Typescript"

    ```typescript
    import type { Part } from '@google/genai';
    import { createPartFromBase64 } from '@google/genai';

    // Assume 'imageBytes' contains the binary data of a PNG image
    const imageBytes = new Uint8Array([0x89, 0x50, 0x4e, 0x47, 0x0d, 0x0a, 0x1a, 0x0a]); // Placeholder

    const imageArtifact: Part = createPartFromBase64(imageBytes.toString('base64'), "image/png");

    console.log(`Artifact MIME Type: ${imageArtifact.inlineData?.mimeType}`);
    // Note: Accessing raw bytes would require decoding from base64.
    ```

=== "Go"

    ```go
    import (
      "log"

      "google.golang.org/genai"
    )

    --8<-- "examples/go/snippets/artifacts/main.go:representation"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.genai.types.Part;
    import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

    public class ArtifactExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Assume 'imageBytes' contains the binary data of a PNG image
            byte[] imageBytes = {(byte) 0x89, (byte) 0x50, (byte) 0x4E, (byte) 0x47, (byte) 0x0D, (byte) 0x0A, (byte) 0x1A, (byte) 0x0A, (byte) 0x01, (byte) 0x02}; // Placeholder for actual image bytes

            // Create an image artifact using Part.fromBytes
            Part imageArtifact = Part.fromBytes(imageBytes, "image/png");

            System.out.println("Artifact MIME Type: " + imageArtifact.inlineData().get().mimeType().get());
            System.out.println(
                "Artifact Data (first 10 bytes): "
                    + new String(imageArtifact.inlineData().get().data().get(), 0, 10, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
                    + "...");
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Persistence & Management:** Artifacts are not stored directly within the agent or session state. Their storage and retrieval are managed by a dedicated **Artifact Service** (an implementation of `BaseArtifactService`, defined in `google.adk.artifacts`. ADK provides various implementations, such as:
    *   An in-memory service for testing or temporary storage (e.g., `InMemoryArtifactService` in Python, defined in `google.adk.artifacts.in_memory_artifact_service.py`).
    *   A service for persistent storage using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) (e.g., `GcsArtifactService` in Python, defined in `google.adk.artifacts.gcs_artifact_service.py`).
    The chosen service implementation handles versioning automatically when you save data.

## Why Use Artifacts?

While session `state` is suitable for storing small pieces of configuration or conversational context (like strings, numbers, booleans, or small dictionaries/lists), Artifacts are designed for scenarios involving binary or large data:

1. **Handling Non-Textual Data:** Easily store and retrieve images, audio clips, video snippets, PDFs, spreadsheets, or any other file format relevant to your agent's function.
2. **Persisting Large Data:** Session state is generally not optimized for storing large amounts of data. Artifacts provide a dedicated mechanism for persisting larger blobs without cluttering the session state.
3. **User File Management:** Provide capabilities for users to upload files (which can be saved as artifacts) and retrieve or download files generated by the agent (loaded from artifacts).
4. **Sharing Outputs:** Enable tools or agents to generate binary outputs (like a PDF report or a generated image) that can be saved via `save_artifact` and later accessed by other parts of the application or even in subsequent sessions (if using user namespacing).
5. **Caching Binary Data:** Store the results of computationally expensive operations that produce binary data (e.g., rendering a complex chart image) as artifacts to avoid regenerating them on subsequent requests.

In essence, whenever your agent needs to work with file-like binary data that needs to be persisted, versioned, or shared, Artifacts managed by an `ArtifactService` are the appropriate mechanism within ADK.


## Common Use Cases

Artifacts provide a flexible way to handle binary data within your ADK applications.

Here are some typical scenarios where they prove valuable:

* **Generated Reports/Files:**
    * A tool or agent generates a report (e.g., a PDF analysis, a CSV data export, an image chart).

* **Handling User Uploads:**

    * A user uploads a file (e.g., an image for analysis, a document for summarization) through a front-end interface.

* **Storing Intermediate Binary Results:**

    * An agent performs a complex multi-step process where one step generates intermediate binary data (e.g., audio synthesis, simulation results).

* **Persistent User Data:**

    * Storing user-specific configuration or data that isn't a simple key-value state.

* **Caching Generated Binary Content:**

    * An agent frequently generates the same binary output based on certain inputs (e.g., a company logo image, a standard audio greeting).
