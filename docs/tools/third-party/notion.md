# Notion

The [Notion MCP Server](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server)
connects your ADK agent to Notion, allowing it to search, create, and manage
pages, databases, and more within a workspace. This gives your agent the ability
to query, create, and organize content in your Notion workspace using natural
language.

## Use cases

- **Search your workspace**: Find project pages, meeting notes, or documents
  based on content.

- **Create new content**: Generate new pages for meeting notes, project plans,
  or tasks.

- **Manage tasks and databases**: Update the status of a task, add items to a
  database, or change properties.

- **Organize your workspace**: Move pages, duplicate templates, or add comments
  to documents.

## Prerequisites

- Obtain a Notion integration token by going to
  [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) in your
  profile. Refer to the
  [authorization documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization)
  for more details.
- Ensure relevant pages and databases can be accessed by your integration. Visit
  the Access tab in your
  [Notion Integration](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) settings,
  then grant access by selecting the pages you'd like to use.
