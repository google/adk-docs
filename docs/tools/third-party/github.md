# GitHub

## Overview

The [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) connects AI
tools directly to GitHub's platform. This gives your ADK agent the ability to
read repositories and code files, manage issues and PRs, analyze code, and
automate workflows using natural language.

## Use cases

- **Repository Management**: Browse and query code, search files, analyze
  commits, and understand project structure across any repository you have
  access to.
- **Issue & PR Automation**: Create, update, and manage issues and pull
  requests. Let AI help triage bugs, review code changes, and maintain project
  boards.
- **Code Analysis**: Examine security findings, review Dependabot alerts,
  understand code patterns, and get comprehensive insights into your codebase.

## Prerequisites

- Create a
  [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) in GitHub. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for more information.

## Usage with ADK

=== "Remote MCP Server"

    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import Agent
    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPServerParams
    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset

    GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"

    root_agent = Agent(
        model="gemini-2.5-pro",
        name="github_agent",
        instruction="Help users get information from GitHub",
        tools=[
            MCPToolset(
                connection_params=StreamableHTTPServerParams(
                    url="https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
                    headers={
                        "Authorization": f"Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}",
                        "X-MCP-Toolsets": "all",
                        "X-MCP-Readonly": "true"
                    },
                ),
            )
        ],
    )
    ```

## Configuration

The Remote GitHub MCP server has optional headers that can be used to configure
available toolsets and read-only mode:

- `X-MCP-Toolsets`: Comma-separated list of toolsets to enable. (e.g., "repos,issues")
    - If the list is empty, default toolsets will be used. If a bad toolset is
      provided, the server will fail to start and emit a 400 bad request status.
      Whitespace is ignored.

- `X-MCP-Readonly`: Enables only "read" tools.
    - If this header is empty, "false", "f", "no", "n", "0", or "off" (ignoring
      whitespace and case), it will be interpreted as false. All other values
      are interpreted as true.
