# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard designed to standardize how Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini and Claude communicate with external applications, data sources, and tools. Think of it as a universal connection mechanism that simplifies how LLMs obtain context, execute actions, and interact with various systems.

MCP follows a client-server architecture, defining how **data** (resources), **interactive templates** (prompts), and **actionable functions** (tools) are exposed by an **MCP server** and consumed by an **MCP client** (which could be an LLM host application or an AI agent).

    ---

    [MCP Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) is an
    open source MCP server for databases. It was designed with enterprise-grade and
    production-quality in mind. It enables you to develop tools easier, faster, and
    more securely by handling the complexities such as connection pooling,
    authentication, and more. Googleâ€™s Agent Development Kit (ADK) has built in support for Toolbox.
