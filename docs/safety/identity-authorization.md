The identity that a *tool* uses to perform actions on external systems is a crucial design consideration from a security perspective. Different tools in the same agent can be configured with different strategies, so care is needed when talking about the agent's configurations.

## Agent-Auth

The **tool interacts with external systems using the agent's own identity** (e.g., a service account). The agent identity must be explicitly authorized in the external system access policies, like adding an agent's service account to a database's IAM policy for read access. Such policies constrain the agent in only performing actions that the developer intended as possible: by giving read-only permissions to a resource, no matter what the model decides, the tool will be prohibited from performing write actions.

This approach is simple to implement, and it is **appropriate for agents where all users share the same level of access.** If not all users have the same level of access, such an approach alone doesn't provide enough protection and must be complemented with other techniques below. In tool implementation, ensure that logs are created to maintain attribution of actions to users, as all agents' actions will appear as coming from the agent.

## User Auth

The tool interacts with an external system using the **identity of the "controlling user"** (e.g., the human interacting with the frontend in a web application). In ADK, this is typically implemented using OAuth: the agent interacts with the frontend to acquire a OAuth token, and then the tool uses the token when performing external actions: the external system authorizes the action if the controlling user is authorized to perform it on its own.

User auth has the advantage that agents only perform actions that the user could have performed themselves. This greatly reduces the risk that a malicious user could abuse the agent to obtain access to additional data. However, most common implementations of delegation have a fixed set permissions to delegate (i.e., OAuth scopes). Often, such scopes are broader than the access that the agent actually requires, and the techniques below are required to further constrain agent actions.
