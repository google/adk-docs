# Configurating streaming behaviour

There are some configurations you can set for live(streaming) agents. 

It's set by [RunConfig](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/agents/run_config.py). You should use RunConfig with your [Runner.run_live(...)](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/runners.py). 

For example, if you want to set voice configs, you can leverage speech_config.
