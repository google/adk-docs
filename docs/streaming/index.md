## What is ADK Streaming?

ADK Streaming adds the low-latency bidirectional voice and video interaction capability of [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) to agents. Using ADK Streaming, you can provide end users with the experience of natural, human-like voice conversations, and with the ability to interrupt the agent's responses using voice commands. The agent can process text, audio, and video input, and it can provide text and audio output.
